# Bottomless Brunch

A React and Redux responsive web-app which graphically renders "bottomless" brunch locations in the United States. Integrated Google Maps, Google Places, and YELP APIs. Created administration back-end which combines multiple APIs to create new locations in seconds. Served on an AWS Server through an NGINX proxy with a Node/Express API.
